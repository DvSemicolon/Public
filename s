          <p>I decided to become a web developer in early 2020 when I was doing very well in my profession as an accountant but I saw that it was not the only thing I wanted in my life, so I looked for something that would motivate me day after day and this was the way, therefore here I am let's say that this is my story, I don't know how far I will go but I know that I will give my all so that one day I can say that I can take a developer job or an accountant job.</p>
